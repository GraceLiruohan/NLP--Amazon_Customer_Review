# NLP--Amazon_Customer_Review

In this project, I delve deep into the world of Amazon reviews, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to extract valuable insights. With a mission to understand the factors that make a review helpful, I employ Apache Spark on Databricks for extensive data exploration and trend analysis. My exploration focuses on deciphering the intricacies of customer reviews, aiming to answer the fundamental question: What makes a review truly helpful?

## EDA
*1st Insight – Time-series Analysis : Quantity does not equate to quality and older reviews are more helpful. ​

*2nd Insight – Review Text Analysis ​: Helpful reviews are ~3X lengthier compared to not helpful reviews​.

*3rd Insight – Sentiment Analysis​ : Helpful reviews tend to strike on  a well-balanced blend of objectivity and subjectivity.
